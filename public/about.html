<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hey there! I'm Abhinav Kashyap, a passionate 3rd-year Computer Science student at Chandigarh University. 
  My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in core CS principles, 
  including Data Structures & Algorithms and Database Management Systems (DBMS), alongside proficiency in C, C++, Python, and Java.</p>

<p>I'm particularly enthusiastic about applying these skills in Machine Learning, where I've developed projects like a Heart Disease Prediction Model and a Stock Price Tracker. 
  Beyond practical application, I'm actively engaged in research, planning to publish papers on "AI chatbots for personalized educational assistance" and 
  "Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms." My evolving interests lie in Cybersecurity, Web Development, and further advancements in Machine Learning. 
  I'm always eager to learn, innovate, and contribute to impactful technological solutions. Let's connect and build something amazing!</p>
